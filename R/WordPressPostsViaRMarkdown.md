I'm totally (re-)inspired with RMarkdown at useR! 2016. A lot going on
including bookdown and markdown documents. The latter making WordPress
blogging reasonable. Here is my first R Markdown generated post.

BTW, I'm putting the .Rmd's up on my [GitHub
here](https://github.com/ds4ci/DS4CI-Posts)

The trick is WordPress will optionally accept .md files as input to the
blog post edit window. To enable, follow the directions on the
[WordPress Markdown page](http://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown/).

R Markdown can produce plain markdown files with variants for different
dialects. See the [RStudio Markdown Documents
page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/markdown_document_format.html)

For WordPress, the YAML output parameter should read

    output: 
      md_document:
        variant: markdown_phpextra+backtick_code_blocks

The workflow is to knit your .Rmd, then copy the generated markdown and
paste into your WordPress Blog Posts|Add|HTML tab.

There are two gotchas:

-   "Note however that if you have embedded plots or other images youâ€™ll
    need to upload them separately and fix up their URLs to point to the
    uploaded location." (from above RStudio page)
-   WordPress does not seem to pick up .md title in its Title box. You
    will need to manually cut & paste the title.

Default RStudio Boilerplate {#default-rstudio-boilerplate}
===========================

As an example we use the RStudio boilerplate. The workflow is:

1.  RStudio: Knit the `<MyPost>.Rmd`
2.  WordPress|Dashboard|Media: Add image(s) from the `<MyPost>_files`
    folder to the WordPress Media Library.
3.  WordPress|Dashboard|Posts|Add New: Copy the md text from RStudio &
    paste into **HTML** tab.
4.  Copy title text from md to Text & delete title lines from the body.
5.  For each image placeholder pointing to R project folder:
    -   Delete image placeholder
    -   Insert
        `<img src="...File URL from media library..." alt="...whatever..." />`

6.  Don't forget to select categories and add tags.  
7.  WordPress: Publish & View Post

R Markdown {#r-markdown}
----------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots {#including-plots}
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](WordPressPostsViaRMarkdown_files/figure-markdown_phpextra+backtick_code_blocks/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
